In-Game Purchases: Managed and recorded by third-party services.
Data Collection from Children
We do not directly collect personal information from children under 13. Third-party services are responsible for ensuring compliance with child protection laws, such as COPPA, including the proper management and deletion of such data.

How We Use Your Information

User Rights
Access and Correction: Direct all requests for data access or correction to the respective third-party service providers.
Opt-Out: To opt-out of data collection or ad targeting, contact the third-party providers directly.
Opting Out of the Privacy Policy
To completely opt out, uninstall the games and cease their use. This does not ensure the deletion of previously collected data. For concerns regarding existing data, contact the third-party ad networks responsible for its collection.

Security
As we do not collect personally identifiable information, the risk of data breaches or misuse is significantly reduced. Third-party providers are expected to implement robust security measures to protect the data they collect.
